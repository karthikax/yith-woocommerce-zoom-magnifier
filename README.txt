== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= The size of the Zoom image is not the size I setted. Why? =
If you enabled the plugin after you uploaded the images of the product you need to [regenerate the thumbnails](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/regenerate-thumbnails/ "regenerate the thumbnails") before to use it. Another reason could be that the size setted for the zoom images is greather than the original image size.

= I'm not able to change the sizes of Zoom Image. Why? =
The size of the Zoom Image is automatically setted. If you want to change these values you just need to untick the option Forcing Zoom Image sizes.
